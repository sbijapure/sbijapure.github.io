<p><h1>For Authors</h1></p>
<p></p>
<p>This site welcomes original, thoughtful writing on self-help–related topics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The essays published here are not meant to offer formulas or expert prescriptions. They are reflective pieces—written from experience, observation, and careful thought—intended to help readers see their situations more clearly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have written something in this spirit and would like to share it with others, you are welcome to submit your work.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>What Kind of Writing Is Suitable</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>Submissions should be original essays, written in clear and accessible language. Plagiarism of any kind is not acceptable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Writing in a conversational way, without jargon, is especially welcome. This site is meant for people from all walks of life, not for specialists or professionals addressing only their peers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may write on topics already covered on the site if you feel you have something new or different to add. You may also propose related topics, provided they align with the overall spirit of thoughtful self-help and reflection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are not research papers. There is no need for formal citations or references to named experts in philosophy, psychology, religion, or other disciplines. General references such as “earlier thinkers,” “traditional wisdom,” or similar expressions are sufficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are sharing an idea or perspective that you consider your own, you are encouraged to say so and take credit for it.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Length and Format</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a general guideline, articles may be between 800 and 2,000 words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Submissions should be sent as a plain text (.txt) file. Formatting will be handled by the site to maintain consistency across articles.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Rights and Compensation</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a non-commercial site.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Authors who submit their work:</p>
<p></p>
<p>retain full rights to their articles</p>
<p></p>
<p>may republish their work elsewhere at any time</p>
<p></p>
<p>grant this site permission to publish the article freely</p>
<p></p>
<p>No monetary compensation is offered. Publication here is intended as a way to share ideas and to receive recognition for clear and thoughtful writing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>How to Submit</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>Please email your article as a .txt file to:</p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>sbijapure@yahoo.co.in</h3></p>
<p></p>
<p>Include the word “article” in the subject line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the limited and simple nature of the site, not all submissions may be published, and individual feedback may not always be possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>A Final Note</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>If this site helps even a few readers reflect more calmly on their lives, it has already served its purpose.</p>
